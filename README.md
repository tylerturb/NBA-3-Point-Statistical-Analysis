# Description - Analysis using Pandas 
3NG, short for 3-point Net Gain. 3NG calculates the number of points a team gains per possession when the player makes a 3-pointer, minus the number of points the team loses per possession when the player misses a 3-pointer. The gain is based on the expected value of points per possession in the league.

This Jupyter Notebook contains Exploratory Data Analysis introducing 3NG. It also introduces EM3A, and EM3, Expected Minutes before a 3-point Attempt, and Expected Minutes before a 3-pointer. I use these statistics to rank 3-point shooters throughout NBA History. Data Wrangling steps have been included.
